### A clean, thoughtfully designed portfolio site made with Express and vanilla JS/CSS.


#### Overview
Official portfolio site of QuiteAFancyEm, developer who does many projects in their freetime and also has a coffee/anime lifestyle.
Nothing special here unless if you want to see the minimalism here :D

#### Setup
Why would you want to do this? shrug~

Well it works fully as a static site but you may do the below if you want to use a very basic environment. shrug~

```
git clone https://github.com/QuiteAFancyEmerald/Timeless.git
cd Timeless
npm install
npm start
```
